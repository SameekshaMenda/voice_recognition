# Voice Recognition System

This project is a Voice Recognition System developed in Python that allows users to interact with the application using voice commands. The system uses the speech_recognition library for converting spoken words into text and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech synthesis. The application listens to user input and provides real-time feedback through audio responses.
